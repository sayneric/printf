Description
 
0x11printf is a custom implementation of the C programming language's printf function. This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program and aims to replicate some of the functionalities of the standard printf function while providing insights into low-level programming and string formatting.
Features
 
	Supports basic conversion specifiers: %c, %s, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X, %o, %p
	Handles width and precision fields for formatting output
	Supports flags: 0, -, +, space, #
	Allows variadic arguments for dynamic content
 
Getting Started
 
To get started with 0x11printf, follow these steps:
 
	Clone the repository:
 
bash
 
git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x11printf.git
 
	Navigate to the project directory:
 
bash
 
cd 0x11printf
 
	Compile the source code:
 
bash
 
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o printf
 
	Run the test suite (if available) or create your own test cases.
 
Usage
 
	Include the holberton.h header file in your C program.
 
c
 
#include "holberton.h"
 
	Call the custom printf function with the desired format string and arguments.
 
c
 
int main(void)
{
    _printf("Hello, %s! Your age is %d.\n", "Alice", 30);
	return (0);
}
 
	Compile your program with the 0x11printf library (if provided) and run it.
 
bash
 
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic main.c libprintf.a -o my_program
./my_program
